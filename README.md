> We are all drown to stories, and historical ones are the most appealing. But history is not accessable easily to people and a tourist guide is needed at any historical site. Our ancestors left us a lot of stories to consume, and likewise, we can leave our own onsite. Both our ancestor's history and our attendance on a geographical spot is a trace that shall never vanishes, and this app tries to make this a reality.
> 
> This application will allow you to discover historical sites by finding close chests in the area you are located or visit. It will also allow you to leave traces behind. Those traces could be text, music, images, or videos. People who pass by the geographical location of the left trace will be able to check what you have left behind.

### User Stories
- As a user, I want to learn about history, so that I recognize valuable historical sites
- As a user, I want to share text at the location I visit, so that other visitors can check
- As a user, I want to share images at the location I visit, so that other visitors can check
- As a user, I want to share music at the location I visit, so that other visitors can check
- As a user, I want to share videos at the location I visit, so that other visitors can check

> This design was planned before on paper, then moved to Figma app for the fine details.
Note that i didn't use any styling library or theme, all from scratch and using pure css modules

Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the Well app uses:

- This project uses the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [Hive](https://hivedb.dev/) package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.
- To send local push notifications, the app uses the [flutter_local_notifications](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications) package which supports Android, iOS, and macOS.
  - ðŸš¨ Currently, notifications aren't working on macOS. This is a known issue that we are working to resolve!
- The app uses the font ["Work Sans"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.
